# Informed Investment from Congressional and Insider Trading

This project investigates whether publicly disclosed trades made by **U.S. congressional members** and **corporate insiders** contain exploitable information that can be used to build profitable investment strategies. Using scraped disclosure data, historical stock prices, and naïve mirroring strategies, we evaluate whether insider transactions yield above-market returns, even when executed at *report-date* prices rather than the true trade date.

This README summarizes the project motivation, datasets, exploratory analyses, and modeling framework.  
The content is based on the final milestone report. (Source: final milestone.pdf)

## 📌 Project Overview

Financial markets are designed to be efficient, but insiders—such as members of Congress or corporate executives—often have early access to non‑public information. Although laws like the **STOCK Act** and **SEC Form 4** require trades to be disclosed, these disclosures may still reveal delayed but valuable signals.

This project explores:

- Whether congressional and insider trades show measurable predictive value.
- Whether a naïve mirroring strategy can outperform index funds.
- How insider activity compares to a passive investing baseline.
- How future models could leverage richer features to extract predictive signals.

## 📊 Datasets

### **1. Congressional Trades**  ￼
Sourced from **CapitolTrades.com**, scraped using a custom parser.  
Key fields included:

- Politician name, party, ownership type  
- Ticker, transaction & report dates  
- Transaction value ranges  
- Transaction type (buy/sell)  

Challenges included coarse monetary ranges (e.g., 15k–50k) and disclosure lags (up to 45 days).

### **2. Corporate Insider Trades**
Retrieved from **OpenInsider**, based on SEC Form 4 filings.  
Included:

- Insider role/title  
- Number of shares  
- Transaction type  
- Filing vs transaction dates  

Covers insider trades from 2020–present.

### **3. Historical Stock Prices**
Collected from **Yahoo! Finance** using public API tools.  
Includes daily OHLCV fields.

Missing historical data for some tickers required filtering out incomplete stocks.

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis

### **1. Price at Trade Date vs. Report Date**
Both congressional and insider trades showed **minimal differences** between reported-date and trade-date prices, meaning report-date mirroring is still meaningful.

### **2. Naïve Insider-Mirroring Strategy**
We purchased stocks at the **report date** and sold them after:

- 1 month  
- 2 months  
- 12 months  
- 24 months  

Both datasets showed **consistent positive drift**, suggesting insiders buy stocks that later increase in value.

### **3. Comparison with Passive Index Funds**
Benchmarks used: **SPY, IVV, VOO, QQQ, VTI**

After removing sub-penny anomalies:

- Insider-mirroring **outperformed all index fund baselines** on average.
- Suggests that disclosed insider behavior still reflects privileged information.

## 🛠 Feature Engineering

Key engineered features included:

- Transaction size midpoints  
- Lag times (trade → report)  
- Insider roles / ownership types  
- Down-sampled datasets for balanced class modeling

## 🤖 Predictive Modeling Approach

The next stage involves:

- Building regression/classification models to predict drift  
- Evaluating robustness across market regimes (e.g., COVID crash)  
- Generating informed buy/sell recommendations  
- Comparing with naïve and baseline strategies

## 📚 Insights and Narrative

Our findings show clear evidence that:

- Congressional and insider trades **retain predictive value**, even after delayed disclosure.
- Market information diffusion is **not instantaneous**, contradicting full efficient market assumptions.
- Publicly disclosed insider trades offer **weak but exploitable signals**.

These insights motivate more sophisticated investment models built on structural features and insider behavior patterns.
